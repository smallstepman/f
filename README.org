Welcome!

* TODOs
** Task 1
- tests
- refactor main logic into separate =fn= or put it into =impl= block
- correct exit code for WindowsOS
** Task 2
- tests
- figure out where the errors are comming from - interestingly, the server works and returns correct value, however while doing so, it throws =panicked at .. Deserialize(Error("invalid type: null, expected a string"))=. The error is present when endpoint returns =block_reward.result.time_stamp=, but is gone when returning =block_reward.result=
- probably refactoring into two files wouldn't hurt
